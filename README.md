# hello-world
Trying out the GitHub hello-world tutorial!


Greetings! I'm an offworlder from another world, and I come in peace. No, I really do.

A few of your "earth years" ago, the FTL drive on my survey vessel fritzed out and transported me to your beautiful blue planet. The drive was rendered inoperable when my ship crashed in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. I sent a radio message home, but it will take over 4 years to arrive. So I must abide my time learning new skills!

Nice place, this planet Earth. Lots of good reading here, like LOTR and Dune. My favorite foods are "Cajun Red Beans and Rice" and perogies. Tacos are pretty tasty too. 

One more thing. Battlestar Galactica should be considered a documentary. It's closer to the truth than you will ever realize.
